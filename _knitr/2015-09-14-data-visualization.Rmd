The readings for this topic are light: I want you to familiarize yourself with `ggplot2`. That means learning to use the search function on the [website](http://ggplot2.org/). 

I also recommend reading 

- Wickham, Hadley. 2010. "A Layered Grammar of Graphics". *Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics*, Volume 19, Number 1, Pages 3â€“28. 

Whenever you run into problems try searching [Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ggplot2) using the `r` and `ggplot2` tags.
