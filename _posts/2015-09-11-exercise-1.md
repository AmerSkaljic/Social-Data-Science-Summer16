You will work on Exercise 1 with Kristoffer in class. The exercise consists of the following parts, try to work on them in the order they are listed. It's not important that you complete everything. 

### If you haven't done so yet, please make sure you've completed [this survey](https://sebastianbarfort.typeform.com/to/xsjlLr) to give us an idea about your background

### Make sure you have R installed and are able to complete the following code


{% highlight r %}
x = 5
y = 10
x * y
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}
## [1] 50
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight r %}
my.missing.object = NA
my.number = 220
z = "we're working on exercise 1"
p = TRUE
{% endhighlight %}

I want you to think about the following and then run the commands to see whether you were correct

  1. What kind of object is `z`
  2. What happens if we run `my.number * z`?
  3. What happens if we run `my.missing.object * my.number`?
  4. What kind of object is `p`?
  5. What is the outut of `my.missing.object == NA`? why do you think this is?


### Working with data. 

Try to read the following dataset


{% highlight r %}
library("readr")
my.df = read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sebastianbarfort/sds/master/data/marijuana-street-price-clean.csv")
{% endhighlight %}

This is a dataset of daily marijuana prices across the U.S. The data is scraped from [priceofweed](www.priceofweed.com). We will talk later about how to do this. The idea behind the website is to crowdsource the price of marijuana 

> We crowdsource the street value of marijuana from the most accurate source possible: you, the consumer. Help by anonymously submitting data on the latest transaction you've made. 

You should know that variables ending with `QN` counts quantity and `Q` lists the price. There are three classes of marijuana quality listed in the dataset: `High`, `Med` and `Low`. 

- first, try to describe the dataset. What simple commands would you run?

- second, I want you to think about pros and cons of using this kind of data? What should we be worried about when working with this kind of data?

- third, think about interesting questions to ask from the data?

- fourth, to test your R skills, try to answer the following questions
  - what are the dimensions of the data?
  - what are the class of each column?
  - which state has the highest mean marijuana price? 

<br>  
  
- fifth, if you have time, look at the documentation for `ggplot2` (run `?ggplot`) and try to create some interesting plots. An example is given below.

<!-- 

- read some data and think 
  - data from priceofweed.com
    - what are pros and cons of this kind of data?
    - are there any alternatives?
    - inflation?
  - what kind of interesting questions can we ask of this data?
  - practical
    - read the data
    - dimensions of the data
    - what are the class of each column
    - which state has highest mean marijuana price?
