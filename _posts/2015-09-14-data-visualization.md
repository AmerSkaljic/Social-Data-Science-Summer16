The readings for this topic are light: I want you to familiarize yourself with `ggplot2`. That means learning to use the search function on the [website](http://ggplot2.org/). 

I also recommend reading 

- Wickham, Hadley. 2010. "A Layered Grammar of Graphics". *Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics*, Volume 19, Number 1, Pages 3â€“28. 

- Kahle, David and Hadley Wickham.
2013.[''ggmap: Spatial Visualization with ggplot2''](http://journal.r-project.org/archive/2013-1/kahle-wickham.pdf),
*The R Journal*, 5(1).

- Gelman, Andrew. 2013. [''Choices in statistical graphics: My stories''](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/presentations/vistalk_meetup_new_handout.pdf). Slides from presentation at New York Data Visualization Meetup.

- Gelman, Andrew and Antony Unwin. 2012. [''Infovis and Statistical Graphics: Different Goals, Different Looks''](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/vis14.pdf).

Whenever you run into problems try searching [Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ggplot2) using the `r` and `ggplot2` tags.
