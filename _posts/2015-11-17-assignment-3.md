I expect the project description to be 1-2 pages describing in as much detail as possible

1. **your idea**: what question are you trying to examine and why is it interesting? Has the question been studied before and in that case what is your contribution?
2. **data**: I want you to describe what kind of data you plan on using to answer the question, where the data is located and a brief outline of an approach to gathering the data. Do you plan on scraping it from a webpage, can the data be called from an API, etc.?
3. **your method**: what statistical method do you plan on using? Is this a prediction problem or are you trying to do inference, and what kind of statistical model do you expect to use?
