Details about the oral exam:

- The exam is scheduled to last **20 minutes** including _everything_. This is not a lot of time and David and I will be strict in enforcing the schedule
- The actual exam will last approximately **12** minutes
- We imagine you will give a _brief_ **5** minute presentation of your project in the beginning of the exam.
- We will use your presentation and project as a starting point for the talk and we will ask you specific questions about the project and more general questions about things taught in the course
- We might ask you during the exam to move on to another topic. You should _not_ be worried about this. It's meant as a help to ensure we get through the most important things in the relatively short time that we have
- Oral exams are generally fun and a great opportunity to examine your thoughts in more detail. We're looking forward to hearing about your projects!
