**Content:**

The objective of this course is to learn how to gather and work with modern social science data. Increasingly, social data--data that capture how people behave and interact with each other--is available online in new, challenging forms and formats. This opens up the possibility of gathering large amounts of interesting data, provided that the analyst has the sufficient computer literacy. Consequently, being an effective social scientist means spending large fractions of our time writing and debugging code. We write code to clean, transform, scrape and merge data that we want to analyze. This course will focus on the challenges that arise during this process, and thereby enhance our chances of posing new and challenging questions.

I will present data science methods needed for collecting and analyzing real-world data. In addition to core computational concepts, the course will focus on **generating new data** (collecting, scraping, working with [APIs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface)), **data manipulation tools** (munging, transforming, cleaning), **visualization tools** (visualizing raw data and model results), **reproducability tools** (git, github), as well as provide an introduction to statistical techniques for predicting and classification.
