Assignment 2


## Markdown Basics

We went over this a little bit too quick last time

Markdown allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format that can be converted into almost any format 

The overriding design goal for Markdownâ€™s formatting syntax is to make it as readable as possible

## Basics

Bold and italics: `**this text is in bold**`; ``*this text is in italics*` renders as **this text is in bold**; *this text is in italics*

Math: as in latex. `$y = X'\beta + \epsilon$` renders as $y = X'\beta + \epsilon$

Can handle citations as well

## Lists

lists: 

    * fruits
        - apples
            - macintosh
            - red delicious
        - pears 
        - peaches
    * vegetables
        - broccoli
        - chard

## rmarkdown = r + markdown

`rmarkdown` let's you write code and text in the same document

The program is smart enough to figure out what is what 

Example

## Renders as...

* fruits
    - apples
        - macintosh
        - red delicious
    - pears 
    - peaches
* vegetables
    - broccoli
    - chard

# git & github 

## Why version control?

Detailed log of all changes.

Easy to revert back to previous versions.

Clear attribution of work (who contributed what).

## git & github

**what is `git`**?
Git is an open source command line program for version control.

**what is `github`**? 
A company/web service that hosts Git repositories and enables 'social coding'

**What is GitHub for Mac/Windows?**
A GUI for Git.

Makes it easier to use.

Ultimately just does command line Git.

## Getting started with Git

Key terms (local):

- Repository (repo): a directory where Git looks for changes

- Initialize (init): have Git begin watching a directory

- add: stage a file so that Git starts watching it

- master: the main branch. By convention this should be the most stable version.

- push: commit changes to a remotely hosted repository

- pull: merge changes from a remotely hosted repository

In GUI GitHub push and pull are combined into sync
