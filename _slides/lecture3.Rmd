**Grammar of Graphics**

> A statistical graph is a mapping from *data* to *aesthetic* attributes (colour, shape, size) of *geometric* objects (points, lines, bars). The plot may also contain *statistical transformations* of the data and is drawn on a specific *coordinate* system. *Faceting* can be used to generate the same plot for different subsets of the dataset. It is the combination of these independent components that make up a graphic.   
- Wickham, *ggplot2*, p. 3.

## Components of a graph 

- **data**: What you want to visualize, including variables (columns) to be mapped to aesthetic attributes.
- **geom**: Geometric objects that are drawn to represent the data: bars, lines, points, etc.
- **stats**: Statistical transformations of the data, such as binning or averaging.
- **scales**: Map values in the data space to values in an aesthetic space (color, shape, size...)
- **coord**: Coordinate system; provides axes and gridlines to make it possible to read the graph.
- **facets**: Breaking up the data into subsets, to be displayed independently on a grid.
